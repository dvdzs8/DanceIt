# Description
A fun project idea I had. Massively a WIP. A website that you upload a video to which plays it back and provides special controls like:
- [ ]  mirroring
- [x]  custom speed presets and increases
- [x]  custom skipping amounts (ie. forwards by 2.7 seconds)
- [ ]  cookies to save setting presets, notes, and the uploaded video
- [ ]  auto video restarting that works for section and full video loops
- [ ]  countdowns
    - pptions: off, start beginning of video, start beginning of loop
- [x]  looping sections
    - click start loop or end loop while paused at that time. playbar is marked/colored
    - if end is before start, make the video loop
- [ ]  timestamped notes that play in big font while you dance able to be edited and deleted
    - [ ]  while playing: notes fade in on the side with big font and a countdown to their timestamp. you can toggle this option
    - [ ]  while paused: notes are displayed in smaller-font list with their clickable timestamps
    - the main pro of danceit (helps long term dance projects like ballet)
    - if full screen, maybe have a toggle notes to pop up over the screen?

Correction: Volume and fullscreen are first-line controls but on left and right respectively

Correction: Video player in top left corner, controls at small bar on bottom, notes at the bottom left. or just check my notepad for better drawing
